## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: GitHub Actions CI Workflow
**Reason**: All publishing is now manual. CI validation workflows are removed to simplify the repository structure and give developers full control over publication timing.
**Migration**: Developers must run `melos pub-check` locally before publishing. No automated CI validation is performed.
